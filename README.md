**Note:** this is a fork of mapcrafter-playermarkers which uses the
[Wurstmineberg Minecraft
API](https://github.com/wurstmineberg/api.wurstmineberg.de) instead of the
[MapTools](https://github.com/m0r13/MapTools) Bukkit plugin. If you're looking
for the original mapcrafter-playermarkers,
https://github.com/mapcrafter/mapcrafter-playermarkers has you covered.

# Mapcrafter playermarkers #

This is a script to show markers of players from a Minecraft server on maps
rendered with Mapcrafter.

The script is free software and available under the GPL license. The PHP-Script
to generate the player images is a modified version of the script TJ09 wrote
([forum
link](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/info-mapmarkers-v0-3-4-1-1r6.843/)).

## Requirements ##

You need some things to use this script:

* A map rendered with Mapcrafter
* A working [Wurstmineberg Minecraft
  API](https://github.com/wurstmineberg/api.wurstmineberg.de) to provide the
  player data
* PHP for your webserver to generate the player images (alternatively, you
  could also use the default player skin or create the player images manually)
* PHP write access to a directory to cache the player images
* PHP-GD library

## Installation ##

* Make sure your API's `/players/:player/playerdata.json` endpoint is working.
* Copy the files from the `playermarkers` directory to an accessible web
  directory.
* Make sure that PHP has write access to a directory called `cache`.

```
ln -s /path/to/minecraft/server/players.json /path/to/www/playermarkers/players.json
```

* Now configure the `playermarkers.js` script. You need to specify the URL of
  the API with the player data and the path to the PHP-Script to generate the
  player images. You can also turn the player movement animation off if you
  don't want it.

* The last point is that you have to include the script into your rendered map.
  Open your Mapcrafter template `index.html` file and add the following lines 
  after the `<script>` section where the Mapcrafter UI is initialized:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/playermarkers.js"></script>
```

* Now you can update the template of your rendered map by running `mapcrafter
  -c <configfile> -r`.

Have fun with the player markers!
